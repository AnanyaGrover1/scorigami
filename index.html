    <h1>What is Scorigami?</h1>
    </p>
    <!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! -->

    <p>
      Inspired by Jon Bois’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l5C8cGMueY&feature=emb_title">original</a> <a
        href="https://nflscorigami.com/">project</a> on the history of the NFL, Scorigami charts every unique score in
      Princeton football during the modern era. For the purpose of this project, the “modern era” begins in 1912, when
      the touchdown was changed from 5 to 6 points, as it is today. Due to the nature of scoring in football — in which
      points are most regularly accrued in chunks of two, three, six, and seven — there are many final scores which have
      never happened. By the end of the 2022 season, Princeton football played 961 games since 1912, 455 (47 percent) of
      which were score Scorigamis.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in the 2022 season, Princeton beat Lafayette 23-2. Princeton had never played in a game that ended
      23-2 – it was a Scorigami! These unique scores are actually quite common when playing Lafayette; in the 31 games
      Princeton has played them, 18 resulted in scores that had never happened before in Princeton’s history. Other
      common opponents with over half of the games resulting in Scorigamis include Brown, Colgate, and Rutgers. 2022’s
      37-10 win over Harvard marked the continuation of a five-year Scorigami streak between the two rivals (all of
      which Princeton won).
    </p>

    <h1>Why is this data meaningful?</h1>
    </p>
    <!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! -->

    <p>
      Princeton played in the first game in the history of college football on November 6, 1869. Since then, they’ve
      played over 1,300 games against 80 different opponents, winning 28 national championships and a Heisman trophy. As
      Jerry Price, the historian for Princeton Athletics, puts it, “Princeton football is a real source of pride. Its
      history is very storied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Bob Surace ’90 became Princeton’s head football coach in 2010, he has seen 61 Scorigamis in his 120 games –
      after his twelfth season, he has the second highest scorigami/season average of all coaches that coached for more
      than two seasons at 5.08.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surace knows how important history is to the team and alumni. “When I meet [a football alum], and it’s very
      humbling. I knew the passion of our alumni, and some research they've done. The history goes way back, and I’m
      quite humbled.”
    </p>
    <h1>Where is the data from?</h1>
    </p>
    <!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! -->

    <p>
      The data is pulled and verified using multiple sources: <em>Athletics at Princeton: A History</em> by Frank
      Presbrey, Bric-a-Bracs, and The Daily Princetonian’s archives.
